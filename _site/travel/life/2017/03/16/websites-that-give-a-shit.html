      <p>Monday afternoon in a closed cafe just outside the walls of Chiang Mai’s Old City I found myself on the edge of tears. I was completely in awe of the strength, perseverance, and genuine kindheartedness of Lisa. I had reached out not completely knowing what I was getting myself into and I couldn’t be happier that I found myself there right in that moment.</p>

<p>It was actually shocking to me that no one had picked up this project yet. This is city full of budding businesses and nomadic skill sets from teaching english online, to development, to dropshipping rocking chairs. We are so eager to move to a cheap Southeast Asian city to take advantage of our strong dollar and live like kings for a fraction of the price that we did in the states. In San Francisco, the average studio apartment was $2,600 per month - madness. In Chiang Mai I can live in a ballin’ apartment in my favorite neighborhood for $300 per month. So, just by getting on a plane I am richer. Woohoo - let’s spend it all! It is important to take a step back sometimes and appreciate the community we are so fortunate to live in. As “Digital Nomads”… (location independence. whatever.) I feel we have an obligation to contribute to the community that we live in. That looks different for everyone - running free yoga classes in the park, painting a temple, volunteering at a school or animal sanctuary. Whatever your skillset is, I know you can find some way to give a shit. This is why I’m introducing my #websitesthatgiveashit project.</p>

<p>#websitesthatgiveashit will be a way for me continually grow my portfolio but more importantly giving a face and a voice to non-profits. It is a promise to myself to stay humble and grounded. It is hours out of my life that will always be worth it. My first mission: Free Bird Cafe.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/versions/dscf2261---x----4896-3264x---.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Free Bird Cafe is a 100% Social Enterprise cafe. Meaning that 100% of the proceeds, yes all of it, fund the Thai Freedom House. The Thai Freedom House is an education center for Burmese Refugees in Thailand. Lisa saved half of her English Teacher salary each month and started the school in an old house in Old City almost a decade ago. The mission from the beginning was always to create a healthy and safe space. Eventually Lisa needed to fund the school so she took the Panini maker out of own house to sell sandwiches - right then Free Bird Cafe was born. Years later it has evolved not only to the healthiest food in Chiang Mai but a hospitality and life skills training program for the Burmese students that work in the cafe. Without the cafe Thai Freedom House would struggle to pay it’s rent, the student employees wouldn’t have enough money to take college exams, and refugees would be without a way to safely receive education and integrate into society. The Free Bird Cafe and Thai Freedom House all works as a fascinating ecosystem. This brief overview will never do the organization justice. The impact is huge and I can’t wait to translate that into digital form so the world can be aware of the magic that happens in this corner of the world.</p>

<p>So if you can find somewhere to give back to the community you are so lucky to live in. Do it. Your community needs you and hey, you might gain a little perspective along the way.</p>

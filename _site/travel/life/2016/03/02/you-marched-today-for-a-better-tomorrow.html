      <h1> You Marched Today for a Better Tomorrow </h1>
      <p class="post-meta">02 Mar 2016 | Written by Laura Treganowan</p>
      <img class="full-width" src="/uploads/1484986378102.jpg">

      <p>7am. Sun shining through the window, my Taylor Swift (Wildest Dreams oddly enough) alarm went off, eyes barely open, I routinely opened Facebook. As I scrolled, my eyes opened more and tears started pouring down my face. What I saw is what I haven’t seen in months: compassion, unity, and virtually no bullies rearing their ugly  internet head.</p>

<p>While the Women’s March may have been sparked out of political angst and controversy – the only thing I saw this morning was humanity and it was refreshing as hell.</p>

<p>I hope that we can carry this humanity with us for ALL of our days. Not just this chosen one. The past year has proved to be a difficult time for America. America was divided in political parties and even further divided by labels. Hate has only been solved with more hate. Fear has only been solved with more fear (What’s up MLK)…regardless of what side of the fence you were on you were labeled as a criminal, a bigot, a misogynist, and the list goes on. I first hand witnessed those who claim to be promoters of equality screaming hateful abuse in bars, faceless slandering on social media, and shutting anyone down anyone and everyone down with an opposing opinion.</p>

<p>Just because you voted for Hilary doesn’t automatically make you an angel – sorry babe. Just because you voted for Trump doesn’t mean you are a misogynistic, homophobe. Shocking, I know. We can always find people with our same views, but the real challenge dropping judgment and listening to a view unlike your own - something we have all forgotten how to do.</p>

<p>Today, all of the madness stopped for a small moment as nearly 3 million people came together and marched in solidarity - peacefully and positively creating visible change.</p>

<p>To the changers of the world, the dreamers, and those who genuinely promote equality:</p>

<p>Step up and be just that. Put a better foot forward. Drop the labels. Drop your pride. Give the person next to yu a hug regardless of who they voted for. Exercise your right of free speech to make positive change. Have faith in humanity. Focus on being your best self every day. Encourage thoughtful conversation. Toss the toxic labels. Open your mind, your ears, and your heart. Take the momentum of what happened today and use it to propel yourself forward. Yes, I am going to quote the words of our new President of the United States,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable”. -Inauguration Speech 2017  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>True dat.</p>

<p>Today and everyday, I am proud to be an American.</p>

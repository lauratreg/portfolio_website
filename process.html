    I build hand-crafted static sites using Jekyll. No templates. No prewritten code. Each website is a unicorn. I give you a incredibly fast website that is easily editable and user friendly. I do not f*ck with Wordpress, PHP, or dare I say it...Wix or Squarespace. Here are the tools I use to build.

    <li> HTML5 and CSS3</li>
    <li> JavaScript and jQuery</li>
    <li> CloudCannon </li>
    <li> Jekyll</li>
  </ul>

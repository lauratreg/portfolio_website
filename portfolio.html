<p>I've worked in health and fitness for the past five years. I've done everything from Corporate Wellness, to working for an outdoor workout series, to being a full-time fitness traveling instructor. Recently I learned how to code and have been freelancing websites as I travel around asia. All from the comfort of my Lulu's. Click below for a downloadable version of my resume.</p>

  <p class="tagline center-text no-padding">...I code for fun!</p>
  <p class="center-text">
    My side hustle is freelancing websites. I build every website is custom built using HTML5, CSS3, and bit of JavaScript. Jekyll pulls it all together - no website builders or templates here! If you want to know how I learned how to code in 10 days check out my blog post about <a target="blank" href="http://www.instituteofcode.com">The Institute of Code in Canngu, Bali.</a>

    Building websites is kind of like having a child (I can imagine)...it can be a long, painful process with moments of happiness and moments when wonder why. And then it pops out it's head may be in the shape of a cone. Websites are similar, always a work in progress and eventually you are done and you are proud of them. Below are my portfolio sites, some are done... some are under construction. I'm not ashamed to show you the process! Check it out.  <br /><br /> You may also peep my GitHub. I apologize in advance for the commit names. <br />

    Do you know of an organization that would love a FREE website? Currently working on Ageless Aviation Dreams Foundation. I will have space to take on another project this fall. Please <a href="/index.html">contact me</a> with any organizations that could use a bosst in their online presence.

    <p>
      Continuously learning is something so important to me. No matter what role I'm in I like to stretch my mind, expand my horizons, and put my free time (between Netflix shows) to good use.

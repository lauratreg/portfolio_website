  <h4>Linea Body Works</h4>
  <p id="subtitle">Massage Therapy - San Francisco, CA<p>
  <p>
    It has been exactly 1 month since I first set eyes on HTML. I had the pleasure of designing and developing a website for Kendra of Linea Body in San Francisco, California. This project was a total brand refresh from logo to finished site. We took her exisiting Wordpress site down and put a temporary landing page up while the site was being built. She wanted to up her website game by creating a clean and modern website with touches of blue and gold. Challenge accepted! A one page scrolling website will give her clients one place to connect,learn more, and book appointments.

  <h5>How I Learned to Code</h5>
  <p>
    I learned to code at a luxurious web development bootcamp in Canngu, Bali. The <a href="https//:www.instituteofcode.com"></a>provides an unconventional approach to education. We were plopped down in a luxury villa with a personal chef, daily yoga, and incredible mentors. Due to the fact that all of our needs were met we were able to focus on learning. In 10 short days we got a great start on Front-End Web Development. I absolutely fell in love with coding and proud that this is my first post-bootcamp project. I am currently expanding my front-end knowledge with further Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery online courses. Projects are only going to get bigger and better from here. Talk nerdy to me!

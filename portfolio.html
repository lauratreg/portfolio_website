  <h4>I Code for Fun</h4>
  <div>
  <p>
    Building websites is kind of like having a child (I can imagine)...it can be a long, painful process with moments of happiness and when it pops out it's head may be in the shape of a cone. Websites are similar; always a work in progress. Here is what I am currently working on. Some are final products. Some are my deformed child.

  <p>
    Do you know of a non-profit that needs a website? Since I am usually bouncing from place to place I volunteer my time by building sites for non-profit organizations. Currently working on Ageless Aviation Dreams Foundation. Will have a space available this fall. Email me with inquires.

<p>I've worked in health and fitness for the past five years. I've worked in Corporate Wellness, to working for an outdoor workout series, to being a full-time indoor cycling instructor. Recently I learned how to code and have been freelancing websites as I travel around asia. All from the comfort of my Lulu's.</p>

  <p class="tagline center-text no-padding">...Coding is fun!</p>
  <p class="center-text">
    My side hustle is freelance web development. I build every website is custom built using HTML5, CSS3, and bit of JavaScript. Jekyll pulls it all together - no website builders or templates here! If you want to know how I learned how to code in 10 days check out my blog post about <a target="blank" href="http://www.instituteofcode.com">The Institute of Code in Canngu, Bali.</a>

    Building websites is a constant creative process from the inital build, to content, to fine tuning letter spacing. Here are a few of my sites. Some are finished projects and some are still under construction. Take a look! For inquires, please send me an email. <br /><br /> You may also peep my GitHub. I apologize in advance for the commit names. <br />

    <h3>Currently Learning</h3>
    <hr class="style1" />
    <p>
      Continuously learning is something so important to me. No matter what role I'm in I like to stretch my mind, expand my horizons, and put my free time (between Netflix shows) to good use.

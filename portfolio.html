<p>I've worked in health and fitness for the past five years. I've done everything from Corporate Wellness, to working for an outdoor sports program workout series, to being a full-time fitness traveling instructor. Recently I learned how to code and have been freelancing websites as I travel around asia. Click below for a downloadable version of my resume.</p>

    My side hustle is freelancing websites. I build every website is custom built using HTML5, CSS3, and bit of JavaScript. Jekyll pulls it all together - no website builders or templates here! If you want to know how I learned how to code in 10 days check out my blog post about <a target="blank" href="http://www.instituteofcode.com">The Institute of Code in Canngu, Bali.</a>

    Building websites is kind of like having a child (I can imagine)...it can be a long, painful process with moments of happiness and moments when wonder why. And then it pops out it's head may be in the shape of a cone. Websites are similar, always a work in progress and eventually you are done and you are proud of them. Below are my portfolio sites, some are done... some are under construction. I'm not ashamed to show you the process! Check it out.  <br /><br /> You may also peep my GitHub. I apologize in advance for the commit names. <br />

  <h4>Give Back</h4>
  <p>
    Do you know of a non-profit that needs a website? Since I am usually bouncing from place to place I volunteer my time by building sites for non-profit organizations. Currently working on Ageless Aviation Dreams Foundation. Will have a space available this fall. Email me with inquires.

    <h4>Currently Learning</h4>
    <p>
      Continuously learning is something so important to me. No matter what role I'm in I like to stretch my mind, expand my horizons, and put my free time to good use.

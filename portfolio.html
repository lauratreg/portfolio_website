  <h4>I Code for Fun</h4>
  <div>
  <p>
    My side hustle is freelancing websites. I build every website from scratch using Jekyll to pull it all together. Building websites is kind of like having a child (I can imagine)...it can be a long, painful process with moments of happiness and when it pops out it's head may be in the shape of a cone. Websites are similar; always a work in progress. Here is what I am currently working on. Some are final products. Some are my deformed child.

  <h4>Give Back</h4>
  <p>
    Do you know of a non-profit that needs a website? Since I am usually bouncing from place to place I volunteer my time by building sites for non-profit organizations. Currently working on Ageless Aviation Dreams Foundation. Will have a space available this fall. Email me with inquires.

    <h4>Currently Learning</h4>
    <p>
      Continuously learning is something so important to me. No matter what role I'm in I like to stretch my mind, expand my horizons, and put my free time to good use.

  <h4>Linea Body Works</h4>
  <p id="subtitle">Massage Therapy - San Francisco, CA<p>
  <p>
    It has been exactly 1 month since I first set eyes on HTML. I had the pleasure of designing and developing a website for Kendra of Linea Body in San Francisco, California. This project was a total brand refresh from logo to finished site. We took her exisiting Wordpress site down and put a temporary landing page up while the site was being built. She wanted to up her website game by creating a clean and modern website with touches of blue and gold. Challenge accepted! A one page scrolling website will give her clients one place to connect,learn more, and book appointments.

  <h5>Kind words from Kendra</h5>
  <p>
      My first REAL client! Yay. Kendra of Linea Body Works in San Francisco had an old Wordpress site that had crazy colors and got hacked. I wish I took a picture of this transformation! First, she wanted the Wordpress taken down. So we put up a simple splash page with contact info while I was building the site. She wanted to up her website game by creating a clean and modern website with a touch of blue and gold. Challenge accepted! A one page scrolling website will give her clients one place to connect,learn more, and book appointments.

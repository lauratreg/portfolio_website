I've been here for just about a month and I thought I would share some important life lessons of my new Thai life… Enjoy!

**Mosquitos are assholes.** I’ve always known this but Thailand makes it even easier to hate mosquitos. My legs might look like actual hamburgers by the time I get home. I’ve tried every bug spray in this country and my skin might just fall off from all the chemicals. So if anyone has some ideas send them my way!

**Tiger Balm**is your friend. You can use it for….everything. The end.

Thai time = your time + at least 30 minutes. Needless to say that my bus ride from Hua Hin to Lamphun was supposed to take 8 hours. 2 days later, 17+ hours, 1 pizza, 4 drinks, 5 hours of sleep, and a sea of tears - I made it.

**Everything is “can walk”.** If it’s your neighbors house or 4 provinces away. You “can walk” there. Forget North, East, South, or West….”can walk” is the only direction you need to know.

**Who potty trained me?**Mom and Dad you never prepared me for the different flavors of toilets out there. Bum Guns and Squatty Potties are Thailand staples. Life is much easier and cleaner once you accept the bum gun. TMI? Too bad, it gets worse with a squatty potty aka hole in the ground in which you will most likely pee on your foot.

While on the subject…always carry toilet paper…with you at all times. But never throw it in the toilet. Duh.

 "It is the little things that you live through each day that you can’t experience any other way."

**I’ll never have to cook again.** No, I didn’t get a boyfriend that can cook.  The Night Markets have everything you could ever want, already cooked, for cheaper than you could ever make it. I got eggs and fruit for breakfast tomorrow morning totaling a whopping 30baht or less than $1USD…..and I thought Chipotle was cheap.

Elephant pants actually make you look like an elephant. End of story.

Attempting the Thai language makes life easier. Trying to be less of a "farrang" and learn Thai! Living in a smaller city with less English speakers has definitely sparked my interest to learn these symbols that somehow turn into words. I'm sure the coconut pancake lady will be happy to know when I've figured out that sip song is 30 (I think?). Wish me luck.

**Appreciate the Thai honesty.** I was told today by a 14 year old that I shouldn't wear mascara because it makes me look tired….when really its just my natural circle of darkness underneath  my unnaturally big eyes. Thanks a lot kid!

Embrace the **Mai Pen Rai** attitude of Thailand. It means no worries…what a wonderful phrase… Everything here will get done, eventually. Not worrying too much about details or really anything. Go about your day, be happy, and you will be just fine - most likely how I ended up living in a pink apartment with my mosquito and lizard friends.

I came here with very little expectation of what life was going to be like. Every day is a twist and a turn in this adventure. It is the little things that you live through each day that you can’t experience any other way. As much as things don’t make sense in Thailand, it works and I wouldn't have it any other way.

XO,
